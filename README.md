# Market-and-Strategic-Interaction-in-Network
By Leo Pan 030025552 and Nicolas Piker 029966545
## Dependencies
We installed the Python `networkx` and `matplotlib` packages. 
## Running the program
When creating the `gml` file, please make sure the node `id` and `label` are just the number itself, and that you don't skip any numbers as well, otherwise it will return an error. 
The `--plot` flag will bring up an image of the nodes with all edges showing.
The `--interactive` flag will bring up a graph with only the preferred paths showing, and it will show every round.
